<b id="Stravinsky">Igor Stravinsky - Rite of Spring: V. Ritual of the Rival Tribes, VI. Procession of the Sage</b>

<p>These two movements of Stravinsky’s Rite of spring represent the street fight between the Montagues and the Capulets. The chaotic nature of this piece contributes to the ideas of violence and conflict, while a theme in the strings and woodwinds, in this case may be interpreted as Benvolio’s attempt at peace.</p>

<b id="Pathetique">Ludwig Van Beethoven - Piano Sonata No. 8 in C Minor, Op. 13 “Patetique”: II. Adagio cantible</b>

<p>This movement of Beethoven’s Piano Sonata No. 8 “Pathetique” represents Romeo and Juliet’s balcony scene, in which they exchange vows and agree to marry. This movement is both peaceful and moving, representing the passionate love they feel for each other so early on.</p>

<b id="Nickel-requiem">Christopher Tyler Nickel - Requiem: VII. Liber Scriptus</b>

<p>This movement of Nickel’s Requiem represents Mercutio’s death, as well as Romeo’s grief and anger at this event. The tone of this movement brings a feeling of unrest, as Mercutio is killed unjustly by Tybalt.</p>

<b id="Verdi-requiem">Giuseppe Verdi - Messa da Requiem: II. Dies Irae: No. 1, Dies Irae</b>

<p>This movement of Verdi’s Requiem represents Romeo’s anger toward Tybalt after Mercutio had been murdered. The relentless driving motion of this movement captures the wrath which Romeo feels, along with grief, as he kills Tybalt.</p>

<b id="Shostakovich-waltz">Dmitri Shostakovich - Jazz Suite No. 2: VI. Waltz 2</b>

<p>This waltz, written by Dmitri Shostakovich, represents the impending marriage of Juliet and Paris, while Juliet is already married. While it may seem a jolly, lighthearted waltz to some, the end of the waltz’s main theme reflects Shostakovich’s somewhat sarcastic style throughout his music, suggesting that something is never quite right, and creating a slight unease with listeners.</p>

<b id="Sky">Vincent Diamante - An Upwards Dance</b>

<p>This track, from Vincent Diamante’s score for the video game “Sky” represents Friar Lawrence’s plan to get them away from their families: Romeo wakes Juliet, and they run away together, to live happily ever after. The light, pretty theme of this piece can suggest that this is in the perfect world of Friar Lawrence’s mind, as he plans to get them both out safely.</p>

<b id="Adagio">Samuel Barber - Adagio for Strings</b>

<p>This piece, written by Samuel Barber, represents the death of Romeo and Juliet as they each, in turn, say their goodbyes as they think the other is dead. This adagio is famous for being one of the most heartwrenching pieces in classical music, and I chose it to represent the grief that Romeo, Juliet, and their families felt at this turn of fate.</p>

<b id="Elgar">Sir Edward Elgar - Cello Concerto in E Minor, Op. 85: IV. Allegro - Moderato - Allegro ma non troppo</b>

<p>This movement of Elgar’s Cello Concerto represents Romeo as a character, being impulsive and idealistic, and quick to change. The juxtaposition of the light and heavy styles in this movement portray this impulsiveness, as his focus shifts from Rosaline to Juliet, as well as his passionate devotion to Juliet after he meets her.</p>

<b id="Debussy">Claude Debussy - Petite Suite L. 65: I. En bateau</b>

<p>This movement of Debussy’s Petite Suite represents Juliet as a character, being innocent but strong-willed, and being a voice of reason to Romeo, who mainly acts on his emotions. The general lightness of this movement can represent love and elegance, but some moments can also represent reason, keeping Romeo at bay.</p>

<b id="Ravel">Maurice Ravel - Five O’Clock Foxtrot</b>

<p>This piece, written by Maurice Ravel, represents the nurse as a character, who is well-meaning, looking out for Juliet and her happiness, but sometimes lacks reason with her ideas of love. The bouncy but consistent style of this piece represents both her maternal and comedic roles in the play.</p>

<b id="Rhenish">Robert Schumann - Symphony No. 3 in E-Flat Major, Op.97 “Rhenish”: III. Nicht schnell</b>

<p>This movement of Schumann’s Third Symphony represents Benvolio as a character, playing a role as Romeo’s cousin and friend, as well as a peace-keeper between the Montagues and Capulets. The style of this piece represents his role as a peace-keeper as he stands a voice of reason, attempting to de-escalate conflict between the two families.</p>

<b id="Verdi">Giuseppe Verdi - Rigoletto, Act III: “La donna è mobile”</b>

<p>This act of Verdi’s Rigoletto represents Paris as a character, being the vain, egotistical character who wants to marry Juliet. The lyrics of the song are written in the context of a misogynistic man complaining that his wife keeps leaving him, fitting Paris’ idea of himself and Juliet. </p>

<b id="Libertango">Astor Piazzolla - Libertango (Arr. M. Skoryk for Cello and Orchestra)</b>

<p>This piece by Astor Piazzolla represents the motif of family conflict. The intensity and the fast pace of this piece represent the escalation of this conflict within the play, as well as its relentlessness and consistency throughout the play until both Romeo and Juliet are dead. </p>

<b id="Overture">Pyotr Tchaikovsky - Romeo and Juliet, Fantasy Overture</b>

<p>Tchaikovsky wrote this overture to represent the play as a whole, writing themes representing events and characters, effectively portraying the direction of the story.</p>
