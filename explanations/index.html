<b id="Khachaturian-waltz">Aram Khachaturian - Masquerade Suite: I. Waltz</b>
<p>
	The movement chosen to represent the Capulets’ party is the waltz from Khachaturian’s Masquerade Suite. This is a heavy waltz, which is chosen to portray the risk that Romeo takes in attending a party at an enemy house, as well as the fate which he predicts for himself. Romeo states, “I fear too early, for my mind misgives/ Some consequence yet hanging in the stars/… Of a despisèd life closed in my breast/ By some vile forfeit of untimely death. This choice of style takes into account the weight, the chaos, and to some extent the jollity of this moment. Romeo finds love, and in the midst of the chaos, he and Juliet share a happy moment together.
</p>
<b id="Fljótavík">Sigur Rós - Fljótavík (Arr. Geoff Lawson for Ensemble)</b>
<p>
	Fljótavík, sung by VOCES8, represents Romeo and Juliet’s love at first sight. I chose this song because of its general beauty, reassuring lyrics, and peaceful tone. In Romeo and Juliet, Shakespeare writes, “Juliet: Saints do not move, though grant for prayers’ sake. Romeo: Then move not while my prayer’s effect I take.” This song supplements the exchange of words Romeo and Juliet share, as they follow their hearts. The lyrics, “Og við sváfum Stórviðri ofsaði út,” translating to, “And we slept / the scary storm was far away,” can represent the moment of peace these two shared in the midst of their families’ rivalry, and in the present moment, the party they were attending.

<b id="Copland-fanfare">Aaron Copland - Fanfare for the Common Man</b>
<p>
	The piece representing Friar Lawrence as a character is Copland’s Fanfare for the common man. Throughout the play, Friar Lawrence is a man of reason, not romanticizing things as Romeo and Juliet tend to do. In Act 2, Scene 3, Friar Lawrence states, “Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here! Is Rosaline, that thou didst love so dear, So soon forsaken? Young men’s love then lies Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.” He is taken aback by Romeo’s sudden change from obsessing over Rosaline to being madly in love with Juliet, and he decides to marry them with hope that it will unite their two families. Although his hopes are never fulfilled, they are more realistic than any of the others’ ideas about love. Friar Lawrence is a common man who plays an essential role in Romeo and Juliet’s journey, and the Fanfare for the Common Man is a fitting piece for this character.
</p>
<b id="Tallis-theme">Ralph Vaughan Williams - Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis</b>
<p>
	The piece representing the motif of love and devotion is Vaughan Williams’ Fantasia on a Theme by Thomas Tallis. This motif is developed throughout the play, starting as a somewhat foolish “love at first sight,” and becoming the one thing that drives Romeo and Juliet forward through their families’ conflict. In Act 2, Scene 2, Juliet says, “Deny thy father and refuse thy name, or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love, and I’ll no longer be a Capulet.” With captivatingly beautiful and heartwrenching themes, this piece sweetly portrays both joy and hardship. Romeo and Juliet experience both to the extreme, making this an appropriate piece for this motif.
